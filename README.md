# Duimon Vintage TV 

## A collection of vintage televisions for use in the Mega Bezel.

I have chosen to split this project from my main collection to make it as painless as possible for those users that only want vintage televisions. The project is a WIP so you can look forward to many additions.

The boilerplate is stripped of any graphics overrides because making changes to the bezel dimensions or component colors doesn't make sense. Shader overrides (Both local and global.) still remain. Please see the boilerplate introduction guide, in my main repo, for information on their use.

Various assets for use in these presets can be found in my "Front-End_Assets" repo, in the "Vintage_TV" folder.

I hope you enjoy using these presets as much as I did creating them.
